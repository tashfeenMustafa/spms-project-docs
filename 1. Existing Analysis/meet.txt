UGC visits to check:
Is department conforming to the OBE model?

Problem.add: there is noDoc for overall performance of department
current: roughly skim through EACH course's assessment report
soln:?

rich.Add process: physically visit kore, enter room with documents. View the documents one by one.
problem: analysing overall department perf is highly inefficient
soln: login and input uni(semester range)-> performance summary. Summary will be created based on PLO achievement. (graphs, bar charts, pie charts)

rich.Add: review process for both 

current:
For faculty to assess student perf:
Ask department to send marksheet for each course Madiha ever enrolled in. 
For each OBE document, find Madiha's ID and find Inefficient.

Difference: Faculty and Head and registrar office might be interested in individual student's performance. UGC or board of trustees is usually only interested in just the department or a course at the most.



6EA. edit: "7. Design course assessment report..." will not be in the mapping. Add to "Produce OBE"
6EA. add: the physical visit for hardcopy thing
bpmn.add: the physical visit for the hardcopy thing ("visit uni" er daan pashe)
6EA. add: "Request to view records" should be for all use cases

Problem analysis

Instead of Leadership team, say "university officials". (Must note: usually the leadership team)

prob.edit (View records): add(student), segregate(faculty)
